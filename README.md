Code The Dream Pre Work for Advanced Classes

The Star Wars API Demo website is a simple single-page application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website uses the Fetch API to retrieve data from the Star Wars API (SWAPI) and display it on the page.

The HTML code consists of a header, a navigation bar containing the People , Films and Species buttons, and a main content section. The JavaScript code listens for click events on the buttons and calls the appropriate API endpoint to retrieve the data. The data is then parsed into HTML format and displayed on the page.

The CSS code is used to style the page and make it more visually appealing. It includes a background image, font styles, and button styles.

Overall, the Star Wars API Demo website is a great example of how APIs can be used to build simple yet powerful web applications. It showcases how easily data can be retrieved from an API and displayed on a web page using modern web technologies.
